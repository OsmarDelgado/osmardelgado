Hiii!!! 

I'm Osmar Delgado, I'm a computer engineer who is passionate for technology.

My focus currently is web programming; however, one of my personal goals is to learn Artificial Intelligence and dedicate myself to it in the future.

I love learn new technologies, currently I improve myself in backend develop using NodeJS.
